<div class=delay id="par2"><span class="blink_me2" id="jack">The universe...</span> (which others call the Library) is composed of an indefinite and perhaps infinite number of hexagonal galleries, with vast air shafts between, surrounded by very <img class="hexs" src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/256/32/32425.png">low railings. From any of the hexagons one can see, interminably, the upper and lower floors. The distribution of the galleries <img class="hexs" src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/256/32/32425.png">is invariable. Twenty shelves, five long shelves per side, cover all the sides except two; <img class="hexs" src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/256/32/32425.png">their height, which is the distance from floor to ceiling, scarcely exceeds that of a normal bookcase. <img class="hexs" src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/256/32/32425.png">One of the free sides leads to a narrow hallway which opens onto another gallery, identical to the first and to all the rest. </div>
